            <h1>Recap-claim</h1>
            <p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology are trying to solve the problem of racial bias in facial recognition to avoid arresting innocent people</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="col border border-5 bg-warning" style="--bs-bg-opacity: .4;">
              <h1>Explanation</h1>
              <p>It has been proven how harmful false positive facial scans have been for many people of color. In this case Robert Willaims was misidentified by a facial recognition program implemented by the Detroit Police department, which led to his wrongful detainment. </p>

              <p>Proper Representation in data sets should be used to mitigate any existing bias</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col bg-success border border-5" style="--bs-bg-opacity: .4;">
              <h1>Explanation</h1>
              <p>In this case studied by the National Institute of Standards and Technology learned that Robert Williams was at a greater risk of being misidentified, because he was a black man. On the other hand the opposite was true for white people. They believe that this is caused by “limited diversity in training images” which cause algorithms to be unable to distinguish unique facial features of darker skin tones. </p>

              <h1>Use of Technology-claim</h1>
              <p>Luxand is a biometric algorithm used by police forces mainly in Europe and is very accurate compared to ones used in America.</p>
              </div>
              
              <div class="col border border-5 bg-primary" style="--bs-bg-opacity: .8;">
                <h1>Explanation</h1>
                <p>This is an extremely highly effective Algorithm that is able to properly recognize facial features (up to 66) compared to many used in America. The company develops and markets a complete set of tools, libraries and solutions to perform fully automatic recognition of human faces and facial features. This means that the problems stated above are less of an issue. </p>

            <div class="row border border-5">
              
              <div class="col border border-5 bg-primary" style="--bs-bg-opacity: .8;">
                <h1>Implications</h1>
                <p>The best way to fix this systemic problem is to switch over to the balanced data sets that companies such as Luxand use and account for all races and features. Biometrics should also not be used in every situation and be limited to severe instances when they are the only option.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col bg-primary border border-5" style="--bs-bg-opacity: .8;">
                <h1>Explanation</h1>
                <p>Equal representation is the only way to avoid groups of people from being harmed by false biometric scans. Despite that humans overestimate the accuracy of biometrics, so they should not be looked to as a first resort. For instance Massechuesetts needs a court order in order for scans and Maine needs probable cause. Two states have instituted a crime limit for face recognition: Maine limits use of face recognition to “serious crimes” (defined in the bill), and Utah only permits face recognition for investigating “a felony, a violent crime, or a threat to human life.”
