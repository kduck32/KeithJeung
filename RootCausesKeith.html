               <h1>Root Cause 1</h1>
               Algorithms are unable to evaluate the nuance in which humans are able to navigate through; thus biometric algorithms inherit any bias that might already be prevalent in society.

              <div class="col-4 col-sm-8 border border-5 border-success bg-light" >
              <h2> Explanation</h2>
              <p>Being an AI trained with using datasets, all Biometric Algorithms can only process certain inputs such as basic skin color and facial characteristics of only the male and female genders. This causes problems, because the biometric Algorithms can misgender or misinterpret a person’s race. Also the distinction between a person’s race and ethnicity is not made due to the lack of representation in the standard biometric datasets. This is known as the “race effect” when Biometrics are unable to detect or misidentify people of certain identities.  </p>

                <h2>Evidence</h2>
                <p>Evidence Humans tend to overestimate the accuracy of their algorithms leading to many problems when we decide to deeply rely on these AI. </p>
               </div>
               <div class="col-4 col-sm-8 border border-5 border-success bg-light">
                <h2> Explanation</h2>
                <p>A lot is unknown about how Biometrics make their decisions which can lead to unpredictable results stemming from their input. Additionally the accuracy of the algorithm is not consistent among all races and genders tending to identify better with white males. This is known as biometric menagerie. Although it is partially caused by unbalanced data sets, there are outside factors that many Biometric algorithms are unable to process such as facial accessories and the quality of camera capture. </p>

            <h2>Implications</h2>
            <p>An overreliance on these Biometric algorithms can be harmful as we use them to make very important decisions such as border control, law enforcement and forensic investigations, voter registration for elections, as well as national identity management systems. Thanks to the problems stated above algorithmic bias can often lead to either false positive or false negative errors. The most likely negative result of a false negative error would be authentication failure, harming peoples of color. Likewise false positive errors also disproportionately impacts people of color by causing higher arrest rates caused by an unjustified amount of surveillance. </p>

                <h2>Evidence</h2>

              <h2> Explanation</h2>
              <p>This will cause an irregular overrepresentation in data sets that leads to misidentification in police cases as well as unjustly stationing more units in minority neighborhoods. This was true in the case of Robert Williams who in 2020 was picked up for the police with no other evidence, besides a facial recognition scan that falsely matched his driver's license. Hence, the police imprisoned an innocent man as a result of demographic bias established by a disproportionate amount of black arrests by the police. </p>

                <h2>Evidence</h2>
                In an attempt to mitigate bias when hiring for jobs by using facial recognition, companies such as Amazon have discovered that the algorithm has inherited bias from previous hirings.

                <h2> Explanation</h2>
                <p>Companies believed that AI could avoid subconscious biases that happen during in person interviews, but failed to account for the fact that these algorithms are fed “ideal” resumes from people who have been hired. This caused AI to analyze which characteristics of a person to avoid and which are ideal candidates. This biased method of hiring was passed onto the AI and Amazon found that their algorithm disfavored resumes that included the word woman. Therefore these existing hiring biases will cause AI to disfavor certain groups of people. </p>
