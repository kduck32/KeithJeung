<!-- Use 4 different types of bootstrap classes -->
<!-- The best way to do this is to search using the navbar. Put in a term OR a class tag -->
<!-- A few pages that should be helpful to start out with.... 
  Use https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/content/typography/ to adjust the display (size, etc)
  Use https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/customize/color/ to adjust color attributes

        <p> Many minorities are experiencing racism due to overrepresentation or underrespresentation in many data sets that cause AI to inherit human bias</p>

        <li>It is very easy to accidently to make an AI biased. For example some AI trained using public data from the internet inherited the racial bias. A possible solution is to teach the AI to differentiate between the racist data sets, but this is just telling AI who to not emulate. Even when using nuanced data sets to mitigate this problem as there are other factors that can make AI less capable of carrying out their duties.</li>
      </div>
      <div class="col text-success">
        <li>AI is also unable to understand real world implications as it processes data mostly as numerical values. For example some companies that use AI to assist in the hiring process lose out on good applicants, because the AI sometimes associates the applicant with a crime-ridden neighborhood. Also it is difficult to understand most machine learning algorithms, so making it hard to fix the problem in the AI. </li>
      </div>
      <div class="col text-success">
        <li>It is possible to explicitly train AI to recognize race as an input in a program by creating a General Adversarial Network; thus eliminating any human bias it might have inherited. However this may harm to any groups that have genuine correlations to their data sets, making our new "anti racist" AI harmful</li>
